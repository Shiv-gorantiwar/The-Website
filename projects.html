            After this i also tried out for the school chess team and represented them at the GMA chess tournament in 2021.

        <p class="content">In grade 11, because of the academic requirements of the grade my competitive chess playing had come to a halt. 
            That was until the school chess approached me, asking me if I would be interested to play in the up coming CBSE clusters and I agreed.
            there our team got Third position which was a little surprising for me considering that almost all of us had stopped playing chess completely.

            as we were in the last year of school we had all come prepared, which paid off as we ended up getting second place which meant we would be going to india to represent our school at nationals.
